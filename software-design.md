# Software Design Considerations

The system uses a web-based architecture with Django for the back-end and React for the front-end, ensuring scalability. PostgreSQL was chosen for the database, focusing on security and reliability.

## Key Design Decisions
- **Back-end Framework**: Django was selected for its robustness, built-in admin panel, and scalability.
- **Front-end Framework**: React was chosen for its component-based architecture, enabling reusable UI components.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL was used for its reliability, ACID compliance, and support for complex queries.
- **Security**: Implemented encryption for sensitive data and role-based access control (RBAC) for user permissions.
