2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Ensured components like appointment booking and doctor schedules interacted correctly.
   - Tools: `pytest` (Python), `React Testing Library`.

3. **System Testing**:
   - Simulated end-to-end workflows, such as patient registration to check-in.
   - Tools: `Selenium` for automated browser testing.

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
   - Involved receptionists and doctors to validate usability and functionality.
   - Feedback was used to refine the UI and workflows.
